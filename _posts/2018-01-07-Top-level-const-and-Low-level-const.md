## Top-level const and Low-level const

- Top-level const: indicate that the pointer itself is a const. Top-level const can appear in any object type, i.e., one of the built-in arithmetic types, a class type, or a pointer type.

- Low-level const: a pointer that points to a const object. Low-level const appears in the base type of compound types such as **pointers or references**.

Note that pointer types, unlike most other types, can have both top-level and low-level const independently.


### Copying rules


The distinction between top-level and low-level matters when we copy an object. 
**When we copy an object, top-level consts are ignored, but low-level const is never ignored.** 

When we copy an object, both objects must have 
1. the same low-level const qualification **or** 
2. LHS has more strict constness than RHS (In other words, there must be a conversion between the types of the two objects. In general, we can convert a nonconst to const but not the other way round)

**Address of a const object is a low-level const**

```c++
int i = 0;
int *const p1 = &i; // p1 has top-level const, &i has no const
const int ci = 42; // we cannot change ci; const is top-level
const int *p2 = &ci; // p2 has low-level const, &ci has low-level const
const int *const p3 = p2; // right-most const is top-level, left-most is low-level
const int &rc = ci; // const in reference types is always low-level
```

| Variable  | Type | Top-level const  | Low-level const  |
|---|---|---|---|
| i   | int  | non-const  | N/A  |
| ci  | int  | const  | N/A  |
| p   | int* | non-const | non-const |
| p1  | int* const  | const   | non-const  |
| p2  | const int* | non-const | const |
| p3  | const int * const | const | const |
| r  | int& | N/A | non-const |
| rc| const int& | N/A | const |


```c++
i = ci; // ok: copying the value of ci; top-level const in ci is ignored 
p2 = p3; // ok: pointed-to type matches; top-level const in p3 is ignored

int *p = p3; // error: p3 has a low-level const but p doesn't
p2 = p3; // ok: p2 has the same low-level const qualification as p3 
p2 = &i; // ok: we can convert int* to const int*, p2 has low-level const but &i doesn't
```

Special cases for reference:
```c++
int &r = ci; // error: can't bind an ordinary int& to a const int object 
const int &rc = i; // ok: can bind const int& to plain int
```

## The *auto* Type Specifier

Unlike type specifiers, such as *double*, that name a specific type, *auto* tells the compiler to deduce the type from the initializer. 

By implication, a variable that uses *auto* as its type specifier **must have an initializer**.

Attention:
- **When we use a reference, we are really using the object to which the reference refers**
- *auto* ordinarily ignores top-level const

```c++
const int ci = i, &cr = ci;
auto b = ci; // b is an int (top-level const in ci is dropped)
auto c = cr; // c is an int (cr is an alias for ci whose const is top-level) auto d = &i; // d is an int*(& of an int object is int*)
auto e = &ci; // e is const int*(& of a const object is low-level const)
```

## The *decltype* Type Specifier

*decltype* returns the type of its operand. The compiler analyzes the expression to determine its type but does not evaluate the expression.

```c++
const int ci = 0, &cj = ci;
decltype(ci) x = 0; // x has type const int
decltype(cj) y = x; // y has type const int& and is bound to x 
decltype(cj) z; // error: z is a reference and must be initialized
```

When we apply decltype to an expression that is not a variable, we get the type that that expression yields.
```c++
// decltype of an expression can be a reference type
int i = 42, *p = &i, &r = i;
decltype(r + 0) b; // ok: addition yields an int; b is an (uninitialized) int 
decltype(*p) c; // error: c is int& and must be initialized
```


Deduction done by decltype depends on the form of its given expression.

When we apply decltype to a variable without any parentheses, we get the type of that variable. If we wrap the variableâ€™s name in one or more sets of parentheses, the compiler will evaluate the operand as an expression. A variable is an expression that can be the left-hand side of an assignment. As a result, decltype on such an expression yields a reference:
```c++
// decltype of a parenthesized variable is always a reference 
decltype((i)) d; // error: d is int& and must be initialized 
decltype(i) e; // ok: e is an (uninitialized) int
```

Attention:

**Remember that decltype((variable)) (note, double parentheses) is always a reference type, but decltype(variable) is a reference type only if variable is a reference.**
